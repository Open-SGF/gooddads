## Context and Problem Statement

In our project, we are using Laravel for the backend and React with TypeScript for the frontend, connected via Inertia. To maintain code quality, consistency, and reduce potential bugs, we need to choose appropriate linters for both backend and frontend code.

## Decision Drivers

- Code consistency across the team
- Early detection of potential bugs
- Compatibility with Laravel for backend
- Compatibility with React and TypeScript for frontend
- Ease of integration with Inertia
- Support for modern TypeScript features
- Community support and documentation

## Options Considered

- **Option 1:** ESLint for frontend and PHP_CodeSniffer for backend
- **Option 2:** ESLint for frontend and PHPStan for backend
- **Option 3:** TSLint for frontend and Laravel Pint for backend
- **Option 4:** ESLint with custom rules for both frontend and backend

**PHPStan:**

- **Pros**
  - Good, because excellent for static analysis and catching type errors
  - Good, because highly configurable and extends PHP_CodeSniffer rules
- **Cons**
  - Bad, because can be overly strict and may require a learning curve
  - Bad, because may necessitate changes in codebase to comply with stricter rules

### Option 3: TSLint for frontend and Laravel Pint for backend

  - Good, because easy to integrate with Laravel workflow
- **Cons**
  - Bad, because may not cover all general PHP linting needs
  - Bad, because less community support compared to other tools

### Option 4: ESLint with custom rules for both frontend and backend

**ESLint:**

- **Pros**
  - Good, because a unified tool for both frontend and backend
  - Good, because reduces the need to learn multiple tools
  - Good, because highly configurable with a wide range of plugins
- **Cons**
