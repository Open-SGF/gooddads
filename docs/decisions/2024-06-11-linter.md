# Choosing a Linter for Laravel Backend and React with TypeScript Frontend Using Inertia

- **Status:** Active
- **Last Modified:** 2024-06-11
- **Tags:** Linter, Laravel, React, TypeScript, Inertia

## Context and Problem Statement

In our project, we are using Laravel for the backend and React with TypeScript for the frontend, connected via Inertia. To maintain code quality, consistency, and reduce potential bugs, we need to choose appropriate linters for both backend and frontend code.

## Decision Drivers

- Code consistency across the team
- Early detection of potential bugs
- Compatibility with Laravel for backend
- Compatibility with React and TypeScript for frontend
- Ease of integration with Inertia
- Support for modern TypeScript features
- Community support and documentation

## Options Considered

- **Option 1:** ESLint for frontend and PHP_CodeSniffer for backend
- **Option 2:** ESLint for frontend and PHPStan for backend
- **Option 3:** ESLint for frontend and Laravel Pint for backend
- **Option 4:** ESLint for frontend and PHP-CS-Fixer for backend
- **Option 5:** ESLint with custom rules for both frontend and backend

## Decision Outcome

*Chosen Option 2 and 4* "ESLint for frontend and PHP-CS-Fixer plus PHPStan for backend", because ESLint is the well-established standard linter for TypeScript while PHP-CS-Fixer allows for catching errors in IDE that Laravel Pint does not. PHPStan will help catch logic errors.

### Positive Consequences

#### Improved Code Quality and Consistency:

- ESLint and PHP-CS-Fixer both help ensure that code follows consistent style and standards, which makes it easier to read and maintain.
- By automatically fixing many common issues, these tools can reduce the number of bugs and errors that make it to production.

#### Time Savings:

- Developers spend less time on code reviews focused on style issues and more time on logic and functionality.
- Automated fixes save time on manual formatting.

#### Early Detection of Errors:

- ESLint can catch potential issues in TypeScript code early in the development process, preventing bugs from reaching production.
- PHP-CS-Fixer ensures PHP code adheres to defined standards, reducing the likelihood of style-related issues.

#### Enhanced Collaboration:

- Consistent code style across the team makes it easier for developers to work on each otherâ€™s code.
- Onboarding new team members is smoother when there's a clear, enforced style guide.

### Negative Consequences

#### Initial Setup and Configuration:

- Both ESLint and PHP-CS-Fixer require initial setup and configuration to match the project's specific coding standards, which can be time-consuming.
- Customizing rules to fit the team's preferences might require ongoing adjustments.

#### Potential Overhead:

- Running linters and fixers can add overhead to the development workflow, especially if they are configured to run on every file save or commit.
- This might slow down the development process if not properly optimized.

#### Strictness Leading to Frustration:

- Strict enforcement of rules can sometimes lead to frustration among developers, especially if the rules are perceived as overly rigid or unnecessary.
- There may be disagreements within the team about which rules to enforce and how strictly to apply them.

#### Tool Dependency:

- Over-reliance on tools like PHP-CS-Fixer and ESLint for code quality might lead developers to pay less attention to writing clean code from the outset, expecting the tools to clean up after them.
- This could potentially lead to a drop in overall code craftsmanship.

#### Complex Integration:

- Integrating these tools into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines might require additional setup and maintenance.
- Ensuring compatibility and smooth operation across different environments can be challenging.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: ESLint for frontend and PHP_CodeSniffer for backend

**ESLint:**

- **Pros**
  - Good, because widely used and highly configurable
  - Good, because strong community support and extensive plugin ecosystem
  - Good, because strong TypeScript support with `@typescript-eslint`
- **Cons**
  - Bad, because can be complex to configure initially

**PHP_CodeSniffer:**

- **Pros**
  - Good, because specifically designed for PHP code standards
  - Good, because integrates well with most PHP projects
- **Cons**
  - Bad, because configuration can be cumbersome
  - Bad, because may require additional plugins for custom rules

### Option 2: ESLint for frontend and PHPStan for backend

**ESLint:**

- See Pros and Cons from Option 1

**PHPStan:**

- **Pros**
  - Good, because excellent for static analysis and catching type errors
  - Good, because highly configurable and extends PHP_CodeSniffer rules
- **Cons**
  - Bad, because can be overly strict and may require a learning curve
  - Bad, because may necessitate changes in codebase to comply with stricter rules

### Option 3: TSLint for frontend and Laravel Pint for backend

**ESLint:**

- See Pros and Cons from Option 1

**Laravel Pint:**

- **Pros**
  - Good, because specifically designed for Laravel projects
  - Good, because easy to integrate with Laravel workflow
- **Cons**
  - Bad, because may not cover all general PHP linting needs
  - Bad, because less community support compared to other tools

### Option 4: ESLint for frontend and PHP-CS-Fixer for backend

**ESLint:**

- **Pros**
  - Good, because it automatically fixes code style issues, reducing the amount of manual work required to maintain code quality and ensures consistency across the codebase.
  - Good, because you can tailor the rules to match the specific coding standards and guidelines of your project.
  - Good, because it supports a wide range of predefined rules.
  - Good, because it has strong community support.
  - Good, because it can be easily integrated into CI/CD workflows, ensuring code quality checks are automated.
- **Cons**
  - Bad, because it requires more upfront configuration time.
  - Bad, because it focuses primarily on code styleand might not catch logical errors or deeper code issues that static analysis tools like PHPStan would detect.

### Option 5: ESLint with custom rules for both frontend and backend

**ESLint:**

- **Pros**
  - Good, because a unified tool for both frontend and backend
  - Good, because reduces the need to learn multiple tools
  - Good, because highly configurable with a wide range of plugins
- **Cons**
  - Bad, because requires extensive configuration to handle PHP code properly
  - Bad, because might not catch PHP-specific issues as effectively as dedicated tools
