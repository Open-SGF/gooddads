## Context and Problem Statement

Our project currently uses ESLint to maintain code consistency and catch potential issues on the frontend. However, we lack a standardized code formatting tool, leading to minor stylistic inconsistencies and increased time spent on code reviews. We are considering adding a code formatter to automate code style consistency across the project. Given our use of ESLint, we need a formatter that integrates well with it. The option under consideration is Prettier.

## Decision Drivers

-   Consistent code style across the project to reduce time spent on reviews
-   Ease of integration with the existing ESLint configuration
-   Community support and ease of use
-   Minimal configuration requirements

## Options Considered

-   Adding Prettier as the code formatter
-   Continuing with only ESLint without a separate formatter

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Adding Prettier as the code formatter," because it integrates well with ESLint, is widely adopted, and provides consistent code formatting with minimal configuration.

### Positive Consequences

-   Improved consistency in code style, reducing time spent on code reviews
-   Automatic formatting, leading to faster development and fewer manual fixes
-   Prettierâ€™s wide adoption ensures good community support and compatibility with other tools

### Negative Consequences

-   Additional dependency in the project
-   Some initial configuration required to align Prettier and ESLint rules to avoid conflicts

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Adding Prettier as the Code Formatter

-   **Pros**
    -   Good, because it automates code formatting, leading to consistent style across the project
    -   Good, because it integrates well with ESLint, reducing potential style conflicts
    -   Good, because it is widely used and has strong community support
-   **Cons**
    -   Bad, because it adds another dependency to the project
    -   Bad, because initial configuration might require minor adjustments to avoid conflicts with ESLint

### Option 2: Continuing with Only ESLint

-   **Pros**
    -   Good, because no additional dependency is needed
    -   Good, because ESLint already helps maintain code quality and detect errors
-   **Cons**
    -   Bad, because it requires manual enforcement of code style consistency
    -   Bad, because it increases the time spent on code reviews due to stylistic discrepancies
