## Context and Problem Statement

In a React/Inertia/Laravel environment, maintaining consistent and tested UI components can be challenging, especially as the application grows. Storybook offers a solution for building and testing isolated components, but introducing it involves considerations regarding setup complexity, maintenance, and infrastructure. Should Storybook be adopted for this project to enhance component documentation and testing?

## Decision Drivers

- Ease of UI testing: Ensuring each UI component can be independently tested.
- Component reusability: Ability to maintain and reference a library of UI components.
- Developer experience: Reduced overhead in setting up and viewing component states in isolation.
- Documentation needs: Providing a visual and interactive documentation reference for current and future developers.
- Design validation: Ability to easily validate implementation of UI components against the design

## Options Considered

- Integrate Storybook
- Implement custom documentation for React components
- Utilize existing [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Integrate Storybook," as it best meets the key decision drivers of isolating component development and improving documentation quality.

### Positive Consequences

- Enhanced component testing: Storybook enables isolated component testing, improving the reliability of UI elements before integration.
- Improved documentation: Components have their own isolated and visual documentation.
- Increased efficiency: Reduces the need for complex setup in development by allowing quick previews and adjustments to components.
- Testing: Easily test UI library components against the design

### Negative Consequences

- Initial setup complexity: Adding Storybook requires some setup and configuration to work smoothly within the Laravel/Inertia structure.
- Potential overhead: Additional dependencies and learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Storybook.
- Maintenance: Requires ongoing updates to ensure compatibility with project dependencies.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Integrate Storybook

Integrating Storybook with React and Laravel to enable isolated testing and documentation of components.

- **Pros**
    - Good, because it provides isolated environments for React components.
    - Good, because it allows visual testing of component states and variations without running the full application.
    - Good, because Storybook has plugins and add-ons that enhance testing, documentation, and accessibility checking.
- **Cons**
    - Bad, because it adds initial setup and configuration complexity.
    - Bad, because it introduces additional dependencies and can lead to versioning issues if not maintained.

### Implement custom documentation for React components

Building custom documentation for React components within the application.

- **Pros**
    - Good, because custom documentation can be tailored precisely to the project’s needs.
    - Good, because it maintains a single-source-of-truth for documentation within the app.
- **Cons**
    - Bad, because maintaining custom documentation is time-consuming and lacks the flexibility of Storybook’s interactive features.
    - Bad, because it does not provide real-time component previews, making it harder to test component variations in isolation.

### Utilize existing shadcn/ui documentation
- **Pros**
    - Good, because it requires zero setup or maintenance.
- **Cons**
    - Bad, because it doesn't reflect changes made within the project.
    - Bad, because it doesn't consider other custom components that might be added within the project.
