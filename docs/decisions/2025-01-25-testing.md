# Testing Options for LMS Project Using Laravel, Inertia, and React

- **Status:** Active  
- **Last Modified:** 2025-01-25  
- **Tags:** testing, Laravel, Playwright, TypeScript, PHPUnit, Vitest  

## Terms
- **Playwright**: An open-source framework for browser automation, enabling testing across different browsers with modern features like parallel execution and user interaction simulation.
- **Vitest**: A fast and lightweight testing framework for modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects, designed to work seamlessly with Vite and support unit and integration testing.
- **PHPUnit**: A popular testing framework for PHP, commonly used in Laravel for writing unit and integration tests of backend functionality.
- **React Testing Library**: A testing utility for React that focuses on testing components from the user’s perspective by simulating real interactions.
- **Unit testing**: Testing individual pieces of code, like functions or methods, in isolation to ensure they work as intended.
- **Integration testing**: Testing how different parts of the application work together, such as interactions between controllers, databases, and APIs.
- **End-to-end testing**: Testing the entire application from start to finish by simulating real user workflows to ensure the system works as a whole.

## Context and Problem Statement

The Good Dads project involves both backend (Laravel) and frontend (Inertia, React). We need to establish a testing strategy that ensures robust test coverage, best practices, and easy maintenance. Should we focus testing in Laravel, TypeScript, or both? How do these approaches affect access to the database, testing practices, and developer experience?

## Decision Drivers

- Comprehensive test coverage across backend and frontend, with emphasis on end-to-end testing.  
- Appropriate use of tools for specific test levels (unit, integration, end-to-end).  
- Clean separation of concerns between backend and frontend tests.
- Developer productivity and ease of writing/maintaining tests.  
- Access to and control over the database during tests.  
- Consistency with existing testing tools and practices.  

## Options Considered

- Focus testing in Laravel using PHPUnit for backend unit and integration tests.  
- Focus testing in TypeScript using Vitest for frontend unit and integration tests.  React Testing Library to be used for integration tests only.
- Use Playwright in PHPUnit (Laravel) for end-to-end testing.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: "Use both Laravel and React for testing at all levels."**
- **Unit Tests**: Laravel PHPUnit for backend logic and Vitest for frontend unit tests.
- **Integration Tests**: Laravel PHPUnit for backend workflows and Vitest/React Testing Library for frontend API/state workflows and components.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Playwright in Laravel PHPUnit for E2E testing of complete workflows.

### Positive Consequences
- Comprehensive test coverage at all levels (unit, integration, E2E).
- Leverages strengths of Laravel and React in their respective domains.
- Playwright provides realistic, browser-level testing for frontend/backend workflows.

### Negative Consequences
- Requires maintaining two separate testing frameworks (PHPUnit and Vitest).
- Developers must be skilled in both backend and frontend testing approaches.
- Coordination is needed to avoid redundant testing across levels.  

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests

#### Laravel (PHPUnit)
Unit tests in Laravel focus on individual components like models, controllers, and utility classes.
- Use Cases: Testing isolated business logic, policies, middleware, and model behavior.
- Pros:
    - Provides fast feedback by running isolated logic without dependencies.
    - Leverages Laravel factories for clean and repeatable test data.
- Cons:
    - Limited to backend logic; no coverage of frontend interactions.

#### React (Vitest/React Testing Library)
Unit tests in React focus on components, hooks, and utility functions.
- Use Cases: Verifying UI components, custom hooks, and frontend logic in isolation.
- Pros:
    - Ensures React components work as intended with mock props and state.
    - Facilitates testing small, reusable units of frontend behavior.
    - Uses a simple, lightweight framework (Vitest).
- Cons:
    - Does not interact with backend logic or the database.

### Integration Tests

#### Laravel (PHPUnit)
Integration tests in Laravel ensure that multiple components work together correctly (e.g., controller handling requests with a model and returning a response).
- Use Cases: Testing routes, API endpoints, and database interactions.
- Pros:
    - Provides database-level validation using migrations and factories.
    - Ensures backend workflows function as expected.
- Cons:
    - Does not include frontend workflows or UI interactions.

#### React (Vitest/React Testing Library)
Integration tests in React validate that components interact correctly with each other and external services (e.g., API requests).
- Use Cases: Testing form submission, state management, and API integration.
- Pros:
    - Tests frontend workflows in a controlled environment with mocked services.
    - Ensures consistent state transitions and data handling.
- Cons:
    - Relies on mocked services, which may not reflect real backend behavior.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

#### Playwright in Laravel (PHPUnit)
Playwright in Laravel PHPUnit enables cross-browser E2E tests simulating real user workflows in a browser environment.
- Use Cases: Testing workflows spanning frontend and backend.
- Pros:
    - Simulates real-world interactions (clicks, navigation, API calls).
    - Provides true end-to-end coverage, including dynamic UI and backend integration.
    - Cross-browser compatibility testing.
    - Access to Laravel’s database, factories, and migrations for clean state management.
- Cons:
    - Longer test execution times compared to unit and integration tests.
